Overview
------------

`xspharm` is an xarray-compatible library that facilitates spherical harmonic transforms. It leverages the computational efficiency of `pyspharm` and the convenience of `xarray` data structures to provide an intuitive interface for processing geospatial data on a spherical domain.

* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation available at https://xspharm.readthedocs.io.

Installation
------------

To install `xspharm`, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install xspharm

This is the preferred method to install xspharm, as it will always install the most recent stable release.


Features
------------

`xspharm` provides a suite of methods to manipulate and transform geospatial datasets:

- `truncate`: Reduces the resolution of a data variable or an entire dataset to a specified spherical harmonic wavenumber.
- `exp_taper`: Applies tapering to mitigate the Gibbs phenomenon in spherical harmonic coefficients.
- `uv2sfvp`: Transforms zonal (`u`) and meridional (`v`) wind components into streamfunction (`sf`) and velocity potential (`vp`).
- `uv2vordiv`: Converts zonal (`u`) and meridional (`v`) wind components to vorticity and divergence fields.
- `uv2absvor`: Changes zonal (`u`) and meridional (`v`) wind components to absolute vorticity.
- `sf2uv`: Derives rotational wind components from a given streamfunction.
- `vp2uv`: Obtains divergent wind components from velocity potential.
- `sfvp2uv`: Integrates streamfunction and velocity potential to produce zonal (`u`) and meridional (`v`) wind components.
